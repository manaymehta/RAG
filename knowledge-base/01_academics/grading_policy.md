# Academic Evaluation System

SSIE follows a 10-point grading scale where 90-100% earns 'O' (Outstanding). Continuous evaluation includes theory exams (50%), practicals (30%), and innovative projects (20%). The No Zero Policy ensures no single assessment exceeds 40% weightage. 

Students may avail the Udaan Remedial Program with personalized tutoring if facing difficulties. For medical emergencies, the FairChance Committee grants supplementary exams within 15 days. Academic probation occurs if CGPA falls below 5.0 for two consecutive semesters. 

The Transparent Evaluation Portal allows revaluation requests within seven days of results. Faculty must provide rubric-based feedback for all project submissions. The system emphasizes learning outcomes over rote performance.
